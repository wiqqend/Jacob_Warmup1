/* CSS (you may use AI assistance for this)
Center the image, caption, and button on the page.
Set a consistent width on the <img> so the layout doesn't shift when the source changes.
Create a .hiden class that sets display: none. Apply this class in your HTML to the end message div.
Style the button to look distinct and clickable.
Style button: disable so it's visually clear the experience has ended. */
